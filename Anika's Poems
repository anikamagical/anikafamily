              <ul>
              
              
              
              <li> Chalk
                     Chalk so cheap, 
breaks onto chips when you write with it, 
some look like chocolate chips. 
Fun to chip  them with your nails. 
Sometimes challenging to write with it. 
Buy cheap chalk which  breaks into chips. 
Cheap chalk cheap chalk can play with it all  day! 
Cheap chalk can break into chips
and brown ones look like chocolate chips!

Brings beautiful greenery
With the best fresh leaves.

           <li>Purple Wonders!!!!!!!
   
      I feel purple when I wear my purple dress.
I smell purple when I smell purple flowers.
I hear purple when purple birds come chirping to the window in the morning. .
I taste purple when I eat grapes.
I see purple when I see my cousin wearing a purple dress.



     
     
     
            <li>Yellow wonders!!!!
            
            
I feel yellow when I am with my yellow stuffed animals.
I smell yellow when I  smell pineapple.
I hear yellow when a bee comes buzzing.
I taste yellow when I eat lemons.
I see yellow when I see the sun.



            
                <li>Going Around!!!!!!!!!!!!  

          I wish to go to every single place in the whole wide world. 
I wish to see my family that lives far away. 
I wish I could have my own plane.
I wish I could make every single place have everything they want.
I wish I could travel to every single state in America.
I wish every single person is happy, healthy, and also wealthy.
I wish I could take my entire family everywhere I go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wish I could be a traveler.
I wish I could meet everyone who is famous in other countries!!!!!
I wish I could own a house in Singapore!!!!!!!!

Addy was playing ball
Addy's neigbors said to call
Addy was eating cheese 
And fell on her peas

 Talking to them day and all night,
 Love them

 That's it for the poems guys! Did you like it? I hope so! I did work pretty hard on this! Now it is time for my stories! I am really really really sorry if I am missing some stories.
 Here are my stories: 
 
 <ol>
  
  
  
  
  
  
     <li>One nice beautiful beautiful sunny morning, three BEST friends were playing !!! Their names were Shelly the tortoise, and the second friend was Ellie the elephant, and the last but not least friend’s name was Pancake the rabbit !!!
   They were getting bored though. But after a while, Ellie got a fabulous, most terrific idea in the whole wide world !!! “Hey guys !!!” said Ellie. “Do you want to hear the most terrific idea in the world?” 
“I’m all eared” said Pancake !!!
“Me too” said Shelly !!!
“Ok then” said Ellie. “We could make...slime !!!”
“Yay” “Best idea ever” Shelly and pancake screamed in shock wondering how Ellie could get such a great idea !!! “Well what are we waiting for?” said Ellie !!! So the three best, best, BEST friends were heading where they thought, would be the best place to go !!! “Ok” said Ellie.
“	 I will be the judge. Ok so we have everything that we need. I will set the timer. Starting now” !!! “Ok...Pancake good job you are putting the glue...and Shelly you are putting...Wow !!! That’s a LOT of glue you dumped in your bowl !!!” said Ellie.
Pancake kept pouring little by little and kept moving onto the next ingredient on the list. While Pancake was pouring little by little, Shelly on the other hand, was dumping everything and before you know it, Shelly was done !!! 
Ellie set the timer for 5 minutes. “2 minutes past” Ellie announced. 




That is it for my stories and poems folks! I hope you enjoyed them! I do have some perticular people, that I would like
